		If you're installing Linux at the same time as installing Windows, read this.

		Windows has

		<br />
		This is fixable quite easily, but is still a massive pain. You should backup your data before

	<h1>Important Advice</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you have an NVIDIA Graphics Card, install the proprietary drivers. Sadly, NVIDIA do
			not release much info about their graphics cards, so there is no Open Source
			implementation.
			<br />
			The
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveau_(software)" target="_blank">Nouveau</a>
			team have worked on an Open Source reverse-engineered implementation of an NVIDIA driver,
			which is a very difficult task. It's a very impressive project, but it is sadly too unstable
			to use regularly, and is incapable of gaming (I get 10fps in CSGO with my 660Ti).
			<br />
			If you use AMD, there are perfectly functional Open Source drivers that will come with your
			Distro!
