# zkldi's homepage

This is the repository that deploys my homepage and the zkldi playground.

# The Playground

It's a monorepo for all my experiments and small projects.
It's also for me to take the opportunity to try out some new tools that I wouldn't get to use on larger projects.

For example, I actually do the CI/CD on my own repo here!

They're all hosted on `https://zkldi.xyz/playground`.

## [Distro Picker](https://github.com/zkldi/playground/tree/master/distro-picker)

This is a simple Linux distro picker aimed at beginners. An issue I had with a lot of existing pickers was that they seemed to be really excited to show off as many distros as possible.

This is great for experienced Linux users looking for something new to tinker with, but for beginners? Don't recommend them Arch.

The tool was built in a day, and was done as an exercise to learn [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). The conclusion? I like Svelte.
