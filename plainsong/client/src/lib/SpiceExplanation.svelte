	The chilies represent how 'spicy' a song is -- how weird it is, really.
	<hr />
	'Not Spicy' implies you can expect to hear pretty much anywhere. On any radio
	station, or even in the shops.
	<br />
	There's nothing about these songs that should ever offend anyone, and you'll
	probably never get asked to turn them off.
	<hr />
	'One Chilli' songs are slightly more experimental.
	<br />
	You'd expect to hear these on radio stations still, especially those that have
	a preferred genre.
	<hr />
	'Two Chilli' songs are experimental.
	<br />
	These songs are likely inaccessible to people who don't already like the genre
	this song is in, but for people who like the genre, they probably won't mind
	it that much.
	<hr />
	'Three Chilli' songs are completely out there.
	<br />
	These songs are abrasive, and are pretty much only accessible to people who already
	like the genre they're in. Put these on at a party if you like getting kicked
	out.

		>NOTE: You might disagree with how 'spicy' a song is. I don't care.
		They're a rough guide that let me separate songs like All Along The
		Watchtower from 299 Addiction.
		<br />
		Also, I <i>especially</i> don't care if you think 'Three Chilli' songs just
		aren't that crazy or anything, and then link me to merzbow or something.
		I know there are crazier things out there. I don't care.
