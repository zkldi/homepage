# Plainsong

A simple server that displays some albums I like.

Built as an excuse to tinker with technologies. This has an incredibly overcomplicated stack,
just for the sake of being able to use it.

## Usage

Compile the server inside `server/` by using `cargo build`.

Compile the `.recmd` maker inside `util/` by using `go build`.

You can also write the files out by hand.

Run the `.recmd` maker to actually add music.
